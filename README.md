# digital-fsp-tutorial-backend

This repository accompanies the [DataKind Data Insights for Financial Inclusion Toolkit](https://difit.datakind.org/). This repository offers you the ability to use, run, and/or edit, the code yourself. 

For each tutorial track released on the website, there is an accompanying jupyter notebook with the same name. 

To use this repository:
1. Clone or download the repository. 
2. In your terminal, run ```conda env create -f environment.yml```.
3. Activate the new environment by running ```conda activate difit``` in your terminal.
4. You are ready to run the jupypter notebooks. 


If you are new to Python, Anaconda, and/or Jupyter Notebooks, please check out the following resources. You will need to install Anaconda and an editor that uses jupyter notebook. If you use Microsoft VS Code, you do not need to download jupyter separately, but their website provides nice documentation about to use and navigate jupyter notebooks. 
- Anaconda (installs Python simultaneously) : https://www.anaconda.com/
- Jupyter : https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/
- Microsoft VS Code (recommended editor, though you are free to use any one you prefer) : https://code.visualstudio.com/download
